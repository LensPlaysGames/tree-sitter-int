** Dependencies

- [[https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter][tree-sitter]] and [[https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter/blob/master/cli/README.md#dependencies][it's dependencies]]

** How to Build

#+begin_src sh
  tree-sitter generate
  cmake -B bld
  cmake --build bld
#+end_src

This will compile and link a shared library ~tree-sitter-un~ within the
~bld~ subdirectory. This shared library must be copied into =~/.
tree_sitter/bin=.

# TODO: Add install target that automatically copies shared library.

** How to Use in Emacs

#+begin_src elisp
(add-to-list 'tree-sitter-major-mode-language-alist '(un-mode . un))
#+end_src

Then use tree-sitter as you would normally. Try
`M-x tree-sitter-query-builder` while in a un-mode buffer!
